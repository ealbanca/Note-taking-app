# Overview - Note Taking App

This TypeScript program implements a browser-based note-taking application that enables users to create, view, and delete notes directly within the browser. The app features a simple form for entering a note title and body, and displays all notes in a list below the form. Notes are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist across page reloads. The app provides user feedback through alert messages for actions like adding or deleting notes, and includes a modal window for viewing note details. All DOM manipulation and event handling are managed using vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript, making the app lightweight and easy to use without external dependencies.

Here is a short video explaining how the Note Taking App works, uploaded on YouTube
